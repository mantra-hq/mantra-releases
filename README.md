## What is Mantra?

Mantra is a desktop app that turns your AI coding sessions into navigable, replayable timelines. Instead of scrolling through endless chat logs, you can scrub through your entire session like a video -- seeing exactly how your code evolved with every AI interaction. It works locally, requires no account, and supports the most popular AI coding tools out of the box.

## Key Features

- **Time Travel** -- Replay any AI coding session as a visual timeline. Scrub forward and backward through conversation turns and watch your codebase change in real time.
- **Project Management** -- Aggregate sessions from multiple AI tools into unified project views. Keep everything organized in one place.
- **MCP Hub** -- Centrally manage MCP servers, tools, and permissions across all your AI coding agents from a single interface.
- **Skills Hub** -- Share and manage reusable Skills (custom slash commands) across Claude Code, Codex, and other supported tools.
- **Message Filtering** -- Search and filter conversations to quickly find the exact turn where a change was introduced.
- **Content Redaction** -- Protect sensitive information before sharing sessions with teammates or in bug reports.
- **Multi-Mode Interface** -- Switch between different viewing modes to focus on conversations, code changes, or file trees.
- **Local-First** -- All data stays on your machine. No cloud accounts, no telemetry, no data leaving your device.

## How It Works

1. **Use your AI coding tool as usual** -- Write code with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or Codex. No plugins or extensions needed.
2. **Open Mantra and import** -- Mantra's Import Wizard auto-detects sessions from your local tool logs. Pick a session and import it.
3. **Travel through time** -- Scrub through the conversation timeline. At each turn, see the full state of every file, highlighted diffs, tool calls, and the file tree -- all in sync.
